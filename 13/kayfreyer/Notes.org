* First Try

Without looking at the video just make it work. Try to use some collection tools and other python
native modules (itertools). Didn't do any tests

By looking at code of other people:
- They used namedtuple for Movies
- For printing they used something called fmt_movie_entry
- They used the template pre-given
- what they used to clean the data
  - replace some unicode \xa0

** Now watch the video

- convert data into defaultdict, directors to movie_namedtuples
  #+begin_src python
    Movie = namedtuple('Movie', 'title year score')  # named tuple for movie

    director = line['director_name']
    movie = line['movie_title'].replace('\xa0', '').replace('\xc2', '')
    year = int(line['title_year'])  # converting to int
    score = float(line['imdb_score'])  # converting to float

    except ValueError:
        continue                    # we're not interested in any incomplete data


  #+end_src
